---

## **Introduction**

The NYC Taxi Trip Dataset contains detailed trip records from taxis in New York City, dating back to 2009. This dataset, provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), captures billions of taxi rides, making it one of the largest publicly available datasets for urban transportation research.

## **Key Features of the Dataset**

Each row in the dataset represents a single taxi trip and contains the following key features:

- **PickupandDrop-off Timestamps**: The time when a trip starts and ends

- **Pickup and Drop-off Locations**: Latitude and longitude coordinates of where the trip begins and ends

- **Trip Distance**: The distance traveled during the trip (in miles)

- **FareAmount**: Total cost of the trip, including base fare, taxes, and surcharges

- **PaymentType**: The method of payment used (e.g., cash or card)

These features provide crucial insights into trip duration, travel patterns, pricing, and customer behavior.

## **Collection Process**

The dataset is collected by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) from yellow and green taxis operating in the city. Each taxi is equipped with a GPS-enabled meter that records key details of every trip, including pickup/drop-off locations, fare, and payment method. The data is collected in real-time and stored in the TLC's central database, then anonymized and made available to the public for analysis.

## **Structure**

We will be focusing on Yellow Taxi trips. The dataset is already available in Parquet format.
